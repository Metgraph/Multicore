# Exercises from CS course Multicore
In this repository I will post my solutions to some exercises taken from the book "An introduction to parallel programming"
## Structure
The exercises are divided into folders. The first level indicates the protocol/library used for the exercise, the second level represent the powerpoint from which I got it (if you have the book, this level will have no meaning for you, but it's useful for me)
